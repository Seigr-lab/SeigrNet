        <h2>Seigr Bigård</h2>
        <p>This is the apiary where the Seigr bees live and work. This apiary is in the forest, by the main hub. The goal is to gradually move all the Seigr wings into the Hub.</p>
        <p>Beekeeping at Seigr is approached with the same principles that guide our technological and creative endeavors: balance, care, and sustainability. The bees are seen as partners in a shared ecosystem, contributing to the health of the environment while also benefiting from it.</p>
